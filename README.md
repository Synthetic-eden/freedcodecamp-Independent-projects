# freedcodecamp-Independent-projects
These are coded python projects that I do on free code camp mostly independent. On the free code camp, you usually do projects while the console assists you, by these projects are the ones where they give you to do on your own. So with minor help of copilot to just assist me at times, most of the code is purely made by me.
